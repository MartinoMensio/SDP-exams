## Point 1

### Question

(2.0 marks) Explain the role of semaphores and mutexes, as thread synchronization primitives on WIN32 systems. Outline the main differences between them. Is a mutex fully equivalent to a binary semaphore (a semaphore with maximum count value 1)? (motivate the answer).

### Solution

TODO, missing

## Point 2

### Question

(4.0 marks) A producer and two (2) consumers interact by means of a simple double buffer, according to the following rules:

- A type `MSG_T` is given
- The buffer is shared (between the producer and the two consumers) array of size two (`MSG_T buf[2];`)
- All messages have the same size (`sizeof (MSG_T)`). The buffer starts empty and can hold up to two messages
- The producer writes to the buffer, the consumer reads from the buffer
- The two cells are never simultaneously available for the same operation. So when `buf[0]` is available for writing, `buf[1]` is for writing, and viceversa. But empty/full conditions need to be correctly handled
- Whenever the "write" cell has been written, and the other is empty (initial case or after reading), the cells swap their role

Answer to the following questions:

- Explain how a proper synchronization of the buffer can be implemented
- Provide an implementation of functions `buf_write` and `buf_read`, according to the following prototypes

```c
void buf_write(MSG_T *msg);
void buf_read(MSG_T *msg);
```

For the sake of simplicity, use global variables for the buffer and all related/required additional data and synchronization objects. Implement synchronization using only mutexes.

Operations are blocking when the buffer is not available for reading or for writing. Do not consider errors, just implement a proper synchronization and mutual exclusion.

## Point 3

### Question

(3.0 marks) List and illustrate the five scenarios that the buffer cache mechanism has to deal with.

## Point 4

### Question

(2.0 marks) List the sequence of disk blocks accessed, and detail the data information that they contain, for the command `ls -l /usr/local/bin`

### Solution

TODO, missing

## Point 5

### Question

(4.0 marks) List the differences between the canonical, raw, and cbreak terminal strategies. Switching to a new strategy is allowed to normal users, or only to the superuser? Which sequences of system calls are used to move from a strategy to another one, and to come back to the previous strategy?
