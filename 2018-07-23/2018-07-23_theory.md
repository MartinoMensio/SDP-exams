## Point 1

### Question

(3.0 marks) Reacalling the definition of a semaphore, and its related system calls, using mutex and conditions, implement the data structure and the system calls:

```c
init_sem(&sem, k)
wait_sem(&sem)
signal_sem(&sem)
```

where **k** is the initial value of the semaphore.

### Solution

## Point 2

### Question

(3.0 marks) A paging system uses 16-bit address and 4K pages and frames. The following is page tables of the running process.

|  Page | Frame  |
| :------------: | :------------: |
|  0 | 2  |
|  1 | 7  |
|  2 | 3  |
|  3 | 1  |

Translate the **hexadecimal** logical address **0x1434** to its corresponding **hexadecimal** physical address.
Hint: Recal that division by a **power of 2** can be performed by a shift operation to the right.


### Solution

*Solution source: Linux > chapter 8: Main Memory > page 20*

**Fact A:** The paging system is **16-bit**, so the total available address is 2^16
**Fact B:** Each page size is **4K** = 2^2 \* 2^10 = 2^12
**Fact C:** Size of pages and frames are equal, so the size each frame is also **4K**

Total number of available pages is **16** (2^16 / 2^12 = 2^4). So the highest 4 bits is used for defining which page is going to be used. The rest 2^12 bits is used as the offset in physical address.

| hexadecimal |  Page Number |  Offset  |
| :------------: | :------------: | :------------: |
| **0x1434** |  0001 | 0100 0011 0100  |

As shown in page 22, the correspoding frame number of the called page, should be chosen from the given table. From the given table, the corresponding frame number is **7**. The physical address will be **0x7434** by replacing the first 4 bits.

Note:
In this special question (because of block size) it is easy to replace, but the actual solution is:

|   | (frame_number * frame_size ) + offset  | Physical Address |
| :------------: | :------------: |
|  Decimal | (7 \* 4 \* 1024) + 1076  | 29748 |
|  Hexadecimal | (7 * 1000) + 434  | 0x7434 |

## Point 4

### Question

(3.0 marks) Given the definition of WIN32 types `PROCESS_INFORMATION` and `STATRTUPINFO`, and the prototype of function `CreateProcess`, explain the role of the two structures in process creation. What does it mean that a process can "inherit handles"? Which handles? what is the difference between a process handle and a process id? Are the two data equivalent? *(motivate all yes/no answers)*

```c
typedef struct _PROCESS_INFORMATION {
	HANDLE hProcess;
	HANDLE hThread;
	DWORD dwProcessId;
	DWORD dwThreadId;
	} PROCESS_INFORMATION;

typedef struct _STARTUPINFO {
	/* Lots of information controlling the window */
	DWORD dwFlags;
	HANDLE hStdInput;
	HANDLE hStdOutput;
	HANDLE hStdError;
	} STARTUPINFO;

BOOL CreateProcess (LPCTSTR lpImageName,
	LPTSTR lpCommandLine,
	LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES lpsaProcess,
	LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES lpsaThread,
	BOOL bInheritHandles, DWORD dwCreate,
	LPVOID lpvEnvironment, LPCTSTR lpCurDir,
	LPSTARTUPINFO lpsiStartInfo,
	LPPROCESS_INFORMATION lppiProcInfo);
```

## Point 5

### Question

(3.0 marks) Given the following piece of code, related to WIN32 DLLs, explain if (and why) it should be part of a `.h` and/or a `.c` file. Which modules should be be compiled with `MYPROJ_EXPORTS` defined?

```c
#ifdef MYPROJ_EXPORTS
#define LIBSPEC _declspec (dllexport)
#else
#define LIBSPEC _declspec (dllimport)
#endif
LIBSPEC DWORD MyFunction (...);
```

Explain the roles of the `LoadLibrary` and `GetProcAddress` functions within the framework of DLLs. Are the two functions used with explicit or implicit linking? *(motivate the answers)*
