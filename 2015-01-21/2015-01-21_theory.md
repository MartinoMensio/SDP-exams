## Point 1

### Question

(3.0 points) Write the sequence of instructions that allow to a process to redirect its standard output on a file `out.txt` when it receive a `SIGUSR1` signal, and to recover the original redirection to the standard output when a new `SIGUSR1` signal is received.

### Solution

TODO

## Point 2

### Question

(3.0 points) Illustrate the syntax used to mounts a file system `/dev/fxyz` on a directory `/mnt/dir` and its effects.  
What happens if directory `/mnt/dir` is not empty? Every user is enabled to mount a file system?  
Which kernel data structures are affected by the mounting operation? How?

### Solution

TODO

## Point 3

### Question

(3.0 points) Implement this precedence graph with the minimum number of semaphores. The processes are 4, and they are cyclic. two instances of process P2 must run in concurrency with process P3.

### Solution

TODO

## Point 4

### Question

(3.0 marks) Explain the role of completion functions in extended (allertable) asynchronous IO. Discuss the main differences between completion routines and asynchronous overlapped IO. Why and how a completion routine follow a recursive programming template?


### Solution



## Point 5

### Question

(3.0 marks) Explain the main features of heaps in Win32. In particular, list the main functions (or operations) that can be used to work on heaps. List the main advantages of using multiple heaps vs. a single heap. Do multiple heaps reduce memory fragmentation (if Yes, explain how, if no, motivate)?
