## Point 1

### Question

(3.0 points) Write the sequence of instructions that allow to a process to redirect its standard output on a file `out.txt` when it receive a `SIGUSR1` signal, and to recover the original redirection to the standard output when a new `SIGUSR1` signal is received.

### Solution

```c
int fd, stdout_orig;
int redirected;
void sigHndlr(int signo) {
    if(signo == SIGUSR1) {
        if(redirected) {
            // restore
            redirected = 0;
            close(1);
            dup(stdout_orig);
        } else {
            // redirect
            redirected = 1;
            close(1);
            dup(fd);
        }
    }
}
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    //...
    fd = open("out.txt", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, 0640);
    stdout_orig = dup(1);
    redirected = 0;
    signal(SIGUSR1, sigHndlr);
    //..
}
```

## Point 2

### Question

(3.0 points) Illustrate the syntax used to mounts a file system `/dev/fxyz` on a directory `/mnt/dir` and its effects.  
What happens if directory `/mnt/dir` is not empty? Every user is enabled to mount a file system?  
Which kernel data structures are affected by the mounting operation? How?

### Solution

`mount /dev/fxyz /mnt/dir` mounts the file system pointed by the special file `/dev/fxyz` on the directory `/mnt/dir`. Inside this directory (the mount point) the files of the mounted file system can be reached. The tree of the mounted file system is attached to the root tree in the specified directory.  
If the directory is not empty, its content is not reachable until the partition is unmounted. Also for this reason, not every user is allowed to mount file system. Only root can do that (or sudoers).  
The data structures affected are:

* mount table: a new entry is created containing pointer to inode of mount point and to root inode of mounted file system
* inode table
  * `/mnt/dir` is marked as mount point and contains a pointer to the mount table entry
  * root inode of mounted file system

Pointers are kept in both directions to allow the navigation up and down.

## Point 3

### Question

(3.0 points) Implement this precedence graph with the minimum number of semaphores. The processes are 4, and they are cyclic. two instances of process P2 must run in concurrency with process P3.

### Solution

```c
// initialization
init(s1, 1);
init(s2, 0);
init(s3, 0);
init(s4, 0);

// 1
while(1) {
    wait(s1);
    // work 1
    signal(s2);
    signal(s2);
    signal(s3);
}

// 2
while(1) {
    wait(s2);
    // work 2
    signal(s4);
}

// 3
while(1) {
    wait(s3);
    // work 3
    signal(s4);
}

// 4
while(1) {
    wait(s4);
    wait(s4);
    wait(s4);
    // work 4
    signal(s1);
}
```

## Point 4

### Question

(3.0 marks) Explain the role of completion functions in extended (allertable) asynchronous IO. Discuss the main differences between completion routines and asynchronous overlapped IO. Why and how a completion routine follow a recursive programming template?


### Solution



## Point 5

### Question

(3.0 marks) Explain the main features of heaps in Win32. In particular, list the main functions (or operations) that can be used to work on heaps. List the main advantages of using multiple heaps vs. a single heap. Do multiple heaps reduce memory fragmentation (if Yes, explain how, if no, motivate)?
