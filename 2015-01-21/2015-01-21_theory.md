## Point 1

### Question

(3.0 points) Write the sequence of instructions that allow to a process to redirect its standard output on a file `out.txt` when it receive a `SIGUSR1` signal, and to recover the original redirection to the standard output when a new `SIGUSR1` signal is received.

### Solution

```c
int fd, stdout_orig;
int redirected;
void sigHndlr(int signo) {
    if(signo == SIGUSR1) {
        if(redirected) {
            // restore
            redirected = 0;
            close(1);
            dup(stdout_orig);
        } else {
            // redirect
            redirected = 1;
            close(1);
            dup(fd);
        }
    }
}
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    //...
    fd = open("out.txt", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, 0640);
    stdout_orig = dup(1);
    redirected = 0;
    signal(SIGUSR1, sigHndlr);
    //..
}
```

## Point 2

### Question

(3.0 points) Illustrate the syntax used to mounts a file system `/dev/fxyz` on a directory `/mnt/dir` and its effects.  
What happens if directory `/mnt/dir` is not empty? Every user is enabled to mount a file system?  
Which kernel data structures are affected by the mounting operation? How?

### Solution

`mount /dev/fxyz /mnt/dir` mounts the file system pointed by the special file `/dev/fxyz` on the directory `/mnt/dir`. Inside this directory (the mount point) the files of the mounted file system can be reached. The tree of the mounted file system is attached to the root tree in the specified directory.  
If the directory is not empty, its content is not reachable until the partition is unmounted. Also for this reason, not every user is allowed to mount file system. Only root can do that (or sudoers).  
The data structures affected are:

* mount table: a new entry is created containing pointer to inode of mount point and to root inode of mounted file system
* inode table
  * `/mnt/dir` is marked as mount point
  * root inode of mounted file system is loaded

The mount table contains pointer in both directions to allow the navigation up and down.

## Point 3

### Question

(3.0 points) Implement this precedence graph with the minimum number of semaphores. The processes are 4, and they are cyclic. two instances of process P2 must run in concurrency with process P3.

### Solution

```c
// initialization
init(s1, 1);
init(s2, 0);
init(s3, 0);
init(s4, 0);

// 1
while(1) {
    wait(s1);
    // work 1
    signal(s2);
    signal(s2);
    signal(s3);
}

// 2
while(1) {
    wait(s2);
    // work 2
    signal(s4);
}

// 3
while(1) {
    wait(s3);
    // work 3
    signal(s4);
}

// 4
while(1) {
    wait(s4);
    wait(s4);
    wait(s4);
    // work 4
    signal(s1);
}
```

## Point 4

### Question

(3.0 marks) Explain the role of completion functions in extended (allertable) asynchronous IO. Discuss the main differences between completion routines and asynchronous overlapped IO. Why and how a completion routine follow a recursive programming template?


### Solution

Completion functions are a way to perform asynchronous IO. The function specified by the programmer is called when the corresponding IO operation has ended. To use extended asynchronous IO:

* the file has to be opened with the `FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED` flag
* the IO operation has to be performed via an extended function (`ReadFileEx`/`WriteFileEx`) passing as a parameter the pointer to the completion function
* the thread has to enter into an alertable state by calling `SleepEx`/`WaitForSingleObject`/`WaitForMultipleObjects`

The completion function receives as parameters the result code, a pointer to an `OVERLAPPED` structure and the number of bytes read/written.

The main differences with the overlapped IO are:

* overlapped IO synchronization require an event (if set to NULL we can wait on the file handle) to wait for. This event (or the file handle) is signalled when the IO is completed.
* completion functions is a way to execute arbitrary code when the IO is completed. In this way more templates are possible

If a completion function launches another IO operation, a recursive programming template is created. The function has to stop the recursion based on some conditions, and decide the offset of the next operation.

## Point 5

### Question

(3.0 marks) Explain the main features of heaps in Win32. In particular, list the main functions (or operations) that can be used to work on heaps. List the main advantages of using multiple heaps vs. a single heap. Do multiple heaps reduce memory fragmentation (if Yes, explain how, if no, motivate)?

### Solution

Instead of having a single heap on which do all the operations, multiple heaps can be created using Win32. The main features are:

* `HeapCreate`: creates a new heap (or open an existing named one) returning a HANDLE to it
* `GetProcessHeap`: returns the handle for the default existing heap
* `HeapAlloc`: allocates on the specified heap some memory (like `malloc`)
* `HeapRealloc`: reallocates some memory (used to ask for a larger/smaller memory region). The returning pointer can be different from the original one! (like `realloc`)
* `HeapFree`: frees a memory region on the specified heap (like `free`)
* `HeapDestroy`: destroys a full heap, freeing all its content

The advantages of using multiple heaps are:

* fairness: if every thread has its own heap, the maximum size of each heap can be set and a memory-hungry thread can not overcome his own quota
* efficiency of allocation: if different heaps are used for different-sized objects, each heap will have only objects of the same size and no external memory fragmentation will be generated
* efficiency of deallocation: to deallocate all the objects stored into the same heap, a single call to `HeapDestroy` is needed. This is particularly useful in the case of linked lists / trees
* locality of references: by creating more heaps, the objects stored inside the same heap will be nearer and probably stored into a few number of pages

Multiple heaps can reduce memory fragmentation if for each heap we allocate objects of the same size.
