## Point 1

### Question

Write the sequence of instructions that allow the bash process to interpret and execute the command

    `p1 | p2 > f1.txt`

where p1 and p2 are two executable files.

## Point 3

### Question

Explain the behaviour of `WaitForSingleObject` and `WaitForMultipleObjects` in WIN32.  
Are calls to the two functions blocking? What can we wait for, with the two functions? How many, and which, different synchronization schemes are possible through WFMO? Is it possible to use WFMO in order to wait for one among multiple events/objects?  
What does constant `WAIT_OBJECT_0` represent?

Given the following loop, where the tHandles array is an array of handles of running threads, and processThreadResult works on the result produced by a thread, explain what the loop does.

```c
    /* wait thread completion 1 */
    for (iThrd = 0; iThrd < N; iThrd++) {
      WaitForSingleObject (tHandles[iThrd], INFINITE);
      processThreadResult (tData[iThrd]);
    }
```

Since the loop forces a given order in waiting for thread completion, write an alternative loop, based on `WaitForMultipleObjects`, where thread results are processed following an order given by thread completions.

## Point 4

### Question

Explain the main features of dynamic libraries in Win32. Motivate the main advantages of dynamic libraries vs. static ones. Explain the difference between implicit and explicit linking. What kind of modification is required by a program in order to become a dynamic library (answer for both implicit and explicit linking).

### Solution

## Point 5

### Question

Which are the roles of files pointers and of the overlapped structures in direct file access on WIN32 systems. Briefly describe common aspects and differences. Provide a brief example of application for both of them. How can we increment by 100 bytes a file pointer in an overlapped structure? (provide an example)  
Does an overlapped structure include an event? Is it automatically created? When is it signaled?
