## Point 1

### Question

(3.0 marks) Explain the difference between the **canonical**, **raw** and **cbreak** modes of the terminal line disciplines. Which is the system call that allows these modes to be set from a C program?

### Solution

TODO

## Point 2

### Question

(3.0 marks) Explain the function of the system call **mmap** and write its prototype, and an example of its use.

### Solution

TODO

## Point 3

### Question

Given this reference string

`112233444412412214432255543`

Compute the **page fault frequency and the mean resident set** for the working set strategy with control parameter tau = 3.

### Solution

TODO

## Point 4

### Question

(3.0 marks) Given the architectural scheme of Windows CE represented below

TODO ![alt](http://link)

Explain the difference between user-mode drivers and kernel drivers. Why (kernel) drivers are represented with a different colour, with respect to other kernel modules? What is the reflector module within the framework of user mode drivers? Is a user mode application, using a user mode driver, linked (dynamically or statically) with the user mode driver?

### Solution

## Point 5

### Question

(3.0 marks) Which are the roles of file pointers and of the overlapped structures in direct file access on WIN32 systems? Briefly describe common aspects and differences. Given a file that contains a sequence of records, corrisponding to the C type `RECORD_T`, write a function:

```c
BOOL ReadRecord(HANDLE hFile, DWORD i, RECORD_T *pRec);
```

which reads the i-th record (`i` is the second parameter) in the file, using direct access. `hFile` is a handle to a file already open. `pRec` is the pointer to a record where to store the result. Provide two implementations: (1) using pointers, (2) using an overlapped structure. The prototype of `ReadFile` is reported below.

```c
BOOL ReadFile(HANDLE hFile, LPVOID lpBuffer, DWORD nNumberOfBytesToRead,
    LPDWORD lpNumberOfBytesRead, LPOVERLAPPED lpOverlapped);
```
