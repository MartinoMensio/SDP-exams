## Point 1

### Question

(3.0 marks)  
a) Describe events in the Windows system and their related system calls. Describe the 4 cases of event signal/release, related to manual/auto reset and set/pulse event conditions.  
b) Given a set of threads working in master-slave mode, with one master and N slaves, we want to use events for two purposes:

* for the master, in order to wait for task completion from a slave (any slave can complete a task under execution at a given time): events are used to communicate completion from a slave to the master
* for the master, to enable a specific slave to start a new task

How many events are necessary ? `1`, `2`, `N`, `N+l`, `2N`, `2N+1`, `2N+2`? (motivate your answer)  
Which kind of events (manual/auto, set/pulse)? Why? (handling of tasks and data is NOT required, just propose a solution for synchronization)

## Point 2

### Question

(3.0 marks) Describe the main differences between static and dynamic libraries, and answer the following questions:

* What are implicit and explicit linking, within the framework of dynamic libraries?
* When are (explicitly/implicitly linked) libraries linked: at compile- load- or execution-time?
* Are DLLs required to be thread-safe (motivate the yes/no answer, and also explain what is threadsafety)?
* Can a DLL be shared, at runtime, among processes?
  * If (the answer is) yes, can it be used to share data among processes using them (e.g. to hold a shared array for reading/writing)?
  * If (the answer is) no, how can a library routine be shared (a single copy is resident in memory) among several processes?

## Point 3

### Question

(3.0 marks) Explain the behaviour of WaitForSingleObject and WaitForMultipleObject in WIN32. 

Are calls to the two functions blocking? What can we wait for, with the two functions? How many, and which, different synchronization schemes are possible through WFMO? Is it possible to use WFMO in order to wait for one among multiple events/objects?

Given the two wait loops written below, explain their wait scheme. Are the calls to WFMO in loop1/loop2 waiting for completion of all, or for one, among many processes/threads? If yes, is the waiting order fixed?

Is it possible to detect which of the waited processes/threads has completed? What does constant `WAIT_OBJECT_0`) represent? Why the first parameter in loop1 is `min (MAXIMUM_WAIT_OBJECTS, argc - 2 - iProc)`, instead of `nProc` ? What are `hProc` and `tHandle`?

```c
/* loop 1 */
for (iProc = 0; iProc < nProc; iProc += MAXIMUM_WAIT_OBJECTS)
    WaitForMultipleObjects (min (MAXIMUM_WAIT_OBJECTS, argc - 2 - iProc), &hProc[iProc], TRUE, INFINITE);
/* loop 2 */
while (ThdCnt >0) {
    ThdIdxP = WaitForMultipleObjects (ThdCnt, tHandle, FALSE,INFINITE);
    iThrd = (int) ThdIdxP - (int) WAIT_OBJECT_0;
    if (iThrd < 0 || iThrd >= ThdCnt)
        ReportError (_T ("Thread wait error."), 5, TRUE);
    GetExitCodeThread (tHandle [iThrd], &ExitCode);
    CloseHandle (tHandle [iThrd]);
}
```
