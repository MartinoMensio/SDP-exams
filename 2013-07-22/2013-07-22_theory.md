## Point 1

### Question

(3.0 marks) Implement this precendece graph **with the minimum number of semaphores**. The threads are 4, and they are **cyclic**. **There are 2 instances of the same thread** (number 3).

### Solution

One semaphore for each thread is necessary because processes are cyclic.

```c
init(s1, 1);
init(s2, 0);
init(s3, 0);
init(s4, 0);

// 1
while(1) {
    wait(s1);
    // work
    signal(s2);
    signal(s3);
    signal(s3);
}

// 2
while(1) {
    wait(s2);
    // work
    signal(s4);
}

// 3
while(1) {
    wait(s3);
    // work
    signal(s4);
}

// 4
while(1) {
    wait(s4);
    wait(s4);
    wait(s4);
    // work
    signal(s1);
}
```

## Point 2

### Question

(3.0 marks) List and explain the steps, the files, and the processes involved in the Unix OS to make the login prompt appear in your screen.

List the steps, the files and the processes involved **during** the login to finally obtain your shell prompt.

## Point 3

### Question

(3.0 marks) Explain the role of filter expressions in the `try...except` blocks. Why the following block calls the `Filter` function?

```c
__try {
    ...
}
__except (Filter (GetExceptionCode()))
```

Is `Filter` a system routine or a user-generated function? What is the role of `GetExceptionCode()`?

Is it possible to raise a user-generated exception? (If yes, how and for what purpose; if no, why?).

### Solution

## Point 4

### Question

(3.0 marks) Explain the support for heap management in WIN32 and motivate the advantage of using multiple heaps over libc memory management (based on `malloc`/`calloc`). Describe an example where multiple heaps can provide a better solution that a single heap.

## Point 5

### Question

(3.0 marks)

a) Describe events in the Windows system and their related system calls. Describe the 4 cases of event signal/release, related to manual/auto reset and set/pulse event conditions.

b) Write a **C code** implementation of a `PulseEvent manualReset` event (using only mutexes and/or semaphores), under the condition that the number of concurrently waiting threads is <=32).
Prototypes of mutex/semaphores functions are reported below:

```c
HANDLE CreateSemaphore(LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES lpsa, LONG cSemInitial, LONG cSemMax, LPCTSTR lpszSemName);
HANDLE CreateMutex(LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES lpsa, BOOL fInitialOwner, LPCTSTR lpszMutexName);
BOOL ReleaseSemaphore(HANDLE hSemaphore, LONG cReleaseCount, LPLONG lpPreviousCount);
BOOL ReleaseMutex(HANDLE hMutex);
```
