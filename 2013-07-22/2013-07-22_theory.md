## Point 1

### Question

(3.0 marks) Implement this precendece graph **with the minimum number of semaphores**. The threads are 4, and they are **cyclic**. **There are 2 instances of the same thread** (number 3).

### Solution

One semaphore for each thread is necessary because processes are cyclic.

```c
init(s1, 1);
init(s2, 0);
init(s3, 0);
init(s4, 0);

// 1
while(1) {
    wait(s1);
    // work
    signal(s2);
    signal(s3);
    signal(s3);
}

// 2
while(1) {
    wait(s2);
    // work
    signal(s4);
}

// 3
while(1) {
    wait(s3);
    // work
    signal(s4);
}

// 4
while(1) {
    wait(s4);
    wait(s4);
    wait(s4);
    // work
    signal(s1);
}
```

## Point 2

### Question

(3.0 marks) List and explain the steps, the files, and the processes involved in the Unix OS to make the login prompt appear in your screen.

List the steps, the files and the processes involved **during** the login to finally obtain your shell prompt.

### Solution

After boot process 0 exists.

* `fork`s and creates process 1
* process 1 `exec`s `init`
* `init` reads the file `/etc/inittab` and for each entry
  * forks
  * the child `exec`s `getty` that opens a connection to the relative terminal
  * on connection, `exec`s `login`
  * `login` prints the prompt
* `init` waits for children deaths to respawn them

During the login:

* `login` reads username and password (disabling echo)
* `login` searches the user id by reading the file `/etc/passwd`
* `login` checks credentials by comparing the checksum of the password with the stored one
* if login is correct, `login` from the file `/etc/passwd` retrieves the user home and shell
* `login` execs the user chosen shell and changes directory to user home
* optionally the shell executes some configuration files (`~/.bashrc`)
* shell prompt is printed

## Point 3

### Question

(3.0 marks) Explain the role of filter expressions in the `try...except` blocks. Why the following block calls the `Filter` function?

```c
__try {
    ...
}
__except (Filter (GetExceptionCode()))
```

Is `Filter` a system routine or a user-generated function? What is the role of `GetExceptionCode()`?

Is it possible to raise a user-generated exception? (If yes, how and for what purpose; if no, why?).

### Solution

If the code inside a `__try` block (corresponding to an `__except` block, not a `__finally` one) generates an exception, the filter expression is evaluated to choose what to do with the exception. Possible actions are:

* execute the exception handler (if the value returned by the filter is `EXCEPTION_EXECUTE_HANDLER`)
* continue to search for outer `__except` blocks (if the value is `EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_SEARCH`)
* continue excecution normally, only possible with continuable exceptions (with value `EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_EXECUTION`)

The filter expression/function is user-generated. `GetExceptionCode` role is to provide to the filter the exception code; this function cannot be called inside a filter function, so its return value is passed as a parameter to the filter.

It is possible to raise user-generated exceptions by calling the `RaiseException` function and considering that some bits in the DWORD parameter have special meaning:

* bits 30 and 31 encode the level
  * 00 means "informational"
  * 01 means "warning"
  * 10 means "error"
  * 11 means "critical"
* bit 29 is set to specify that this is a user-generated exception
* bit 28 is reserved, so never set it
* bits 0-27 can be set arbitrarly

The purpose to generate an exception is to unwind the stack faster than doing return-check based error detection. This is particularly useful when we want to return to many stack-frames up (in a nested-called function).

## Point 4

### Question

(3.0 marks) Explain the support for heap management in WIN32 and motivate the advantage of using multiple heaps over libc memory management (based on `malloc`/`calloc`). Describe an example where multiple heaps can provide a better solution that a single heap.

### Solution

WIN32 offers a heap API to create, delete and use different heaps. libc with `alloc` and `free` functions uses a single heap (actually those functions are mapped on the WIN32 system calls on Windows systems). The heap API most useful functions are:

* `HeapCreate`: creates a new heap of the desired size. If the size parameter is zero, the heap is growable
* `HeapDestroy`: deletes a full heap
* `HeapAlloc`: allocates space on a specified heap
* `HeapFree`: frees space previously allocated
* `HeapRealloc`: extends/reduces an already allocated memory block, possibly chnanging its address (can be prevented)

Advantages of multiple heaps:

* Fairness: in a multi-threaded program, if each thread uses a different heap with a maximum size, heap-hungry threads will not prevent other threads from allocating resources
* Efficiency of allocation: if heaps are dedicated to allocate fixed-sized records, the heap does not suffer from fragmentation. Every heap is dedicated to records with a specific size
* Efficiency of deallocation: a whole heap can bre freed with a single call to `HeapDestroy`. No need to follow pointers in data structures like linked lists, trees, ...
* Locality of references: splitting data in more heaps can provide better performances if well partitioned. The references in a section of code will be inside a specific range of near addresses, requiring less page swaps

Example: a graph has nodes and edges. Their structures have different, but fixed size. A heap can be used for nodes and another for edges, so allocation won't be fragmented. Also freeing space is faster because only two calls to `HeapDestroy` are necessary.

## Point 5

### Question

(3.0 marks)

a) Describe events in the Windows system and their related system calls. Describe the 4 cases of event signal/release, related to manual/auto reset and set/pulse event conditions.

b) Write a **C code** implementation of a `PulseEvent manualReset` event (using only mutexes and/or semaphores), under the condition that the number of concurrently waiting threads is <=32).
Prototypes of mutex/semaphores functions are reported below:

```c
HANDLE CreateSemaphore(LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES lpsa, LONG cSemInitial, LONG cSemMax, LPCTSTR lpszSemName);
HANDLE CreateMutex(LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES lpsa, BOOL fInitialOwner, LPCTSTR lpszMutexName);
BOOL ReleaseSemaphore(HANDLE hSemaphore, LONG cReleaseCount, LPLONG lpPreviousCount);
BOOL ReleaseMutex(HANDLE hMutex);
```

### Solution
