## Point 4

### Question

(3.0 marks) Briefly explain the difference between **implicit** and **explicit linking** within the framework of Win32 DLLs. Answer the following questions *(motivate all yes/no answers)*:

* Can a DLL include routines that are NOT thread safe?
* Can a DLL be used to share global variables between any two processes? Can memory mapped files be used to share global variables between any two processes?
* Given the same DLL source code (including 10 library functions), can explicit linging (of the DLL within an executable file) provide less memory usage than implicit linking?

### Answer

## Point 5

### Question

(3.0 marks) Given the (partial) Win32 producer/consumer code in figure, briefly explain its behavior (limited to the instructions reported) and answer the following questions *(motivate the yes/no answers)*:

* Is the mutex always released by the producer, also after an exception occurrs while filling the message?
* Is it possible to have multiple consumers reading tha same message? If yes, how should the event be set in order to just activate all consumers waiting when the event is set?
* Would the producer have the same behavior after swapping the `try...finally` and the `try...except` blocks?

```c
// Producer
WaitForSingleObject(mblock.mguard, INFINITE);
__try {
    __try {
        ...
        MessageFill(&mblock);
        SetEvent(mblock.mready); /* Signal that a message is ready */
        ...
    }
    __finally { ReleaseMutex (mblock.mguard); }
}
__except (EXCEPTION_EXECUTE_HANDLER) {
    printf("Exception while Filling a message\n");
}

// Consumer
WaitForSingleObject(mblock.mready, INFINITE);
WaitForSingleObject(mblock.mguard, INFINITE);
__try {
    ...
    MessageDisplay(&mblock);
    ...
}
__finally { ReleaseMutex(mblock.mguard); }
```
