## Point 1

### Question

(3.0 marks) Explain the main features of asynchronous I/O (in WIN 32) based on extended I/O with completion routines: ReadFileEx, WriteFileEx.  
Why and how this is different from asynchronous I/O based on the overlapped structures?  
Given a binary file containing a sequence of integer numbers, is it possible to write a main program that, using asynchronous I/O, just searches a given number in the file? If yes, can it be done with both overlapped I/O and with completion routines? Why/How? *(source code is not required)*

### Solution

Asynchronous I/O works as follows:

* There is an handle to a file that has been opened with the flag `FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED`
* The thread calls a function like `ReadFileEx` or `WriteFileEx`, passing an additional argument that is the completion routine to be called. In this way the I/O operation is submitted and can start.
* The thread, later on, goes to an **alertable wait state** by calling one of the functions like `SleepEx`, `WaitForSingleObjectEx`, `WaitForMultipleObjectEx`. At this point the completion routines that correspond to completed I/O are executed in the current thread. If no I/O requests are completed, the thread waits for at least one of them, and then executes its completion routine.
* The thread is resumed its normal execution (and exits from the alertable state).

The main differences with asynchronous overlapped I/O are:

* The event is not used. The `hEvent` in the overlapped structure can be used by the programmer to store some data useful to the completion routine.
* The synchronization scheme has more possibilities: on completion of I/O the programmer can execute arbitrary code instead of only having an event signalled.
* The programmer can create some "recursive" schemes by making the completion routine to submit a new I/O operation.

Given the binary file containing a sequence of integer numbers, it is possible to write a main program that searches a given number.

By using overlapped I/O:

* The main splits (logically) the file into partitions. For each one of them it creates an event (manual reset).
* The main submits a bunch of read requests (on the first partitions) by passing overlapped structures containing the corresponding event
* The main enters a loop in which:
  * Waits for the array of events (not all, only the ones that correspond to current reads) by using `WaitForMultipleObjects` with `bWaitAll` to `FALSE`
  * When an event is signalled, searches into the corresponding read partition the number
  * If the number is found, the submitted read requests are aborted (by calling `CancelIoEx`)
  * Else another read is submitted (updating the array of handles to events) if there are still partitions to read

By using completion routines:

* The main splits (logically) the file into partitions.
* The main submits the read of the first partition by passing a completion routine
* The main waits for the search to be ended
* The completion routine searches in the read data the number
* If the number is found (or the file finished), sets a flag that can be seen by the main and returns
* If the number is not found, launches another read by passing itself as a completion routine (after having modified the offset in the overlapped structure)

### Question

 (3 0 marks) Explain the roles of conditional variables and mutexes as thread synchronization primitives in WIN32 systems. Outline the main differences between them. Provide an example of usage *(Pseudo-code is allowed)*.  
 Is it possible to use them to synchronise two processes? *(motivate the answer)*

## Point 3

### Question

 (3.0 marks) Explain the behaviour of `CreateFileMapping`, `OpenFileMapping`, and `MapViewOfFile` in WIN 32. What does the `HANDLE` returned by `CreateFileMapping`? Does `MapViewOfFile` return a pointer or a `HANDLE`?

Given program fragment written below, explain its behaviour, assuming that function `SortIntegerArray` implements a sorting algorithm.  
What is done at each iteration?  
Complete the two instructions assigning values to high and low (assuming that their values need to be properly generate from offset).  
What are `hmap` and `pView`?

```c
...
HANDLE hmap = CreateFileMapping(hfile,...);
if (hmap != NULL) {
    for (offset = 0; offset < cbFile; offset -= cbView){
        ...
        high = ...
        low = ...
        int *pView = MapViewOfFile(hmap, FILE_MAP_READ, high, low, cbView);
        if (pView != NULL) {
            SortIntegerArray(pView, cbView/(sizeof (int)));
        }
    }
}
CloseHandle(hmap);
```
