## Point 1

### Question

(3.0 marks) Which are the Unix commands for installing a new module, for listing installed modules, for removing modules? Standard IO functions, such as **printf** cannot be used in module programs, why? Which function is used instead? In which file does the output of module go?


### Solution

TODO, missing

## Point 2

### Question

(3.0 marks) Write the pseudo-code of a concurrent program that includes **4 cyclic processes (P1, P2, P3, P4)**. The inital statement of every process is **sleep(r)**, where **r** is a random int. After executing **P1**, two instances of **P2** are executed, then after the **P2** processes terminate, three instances of **P3** must be executed. At every cycle, process **P4** can be executed in parallel with process **P3**, but in mutual exclusion with process **P2**. After all **P3** have terminated, the cycle starts again with **P1**. Use the minimum number of semaphores, and counters, for synchronization.

## Point 3

### Question

(3.0 marks)
(a) Why many Memory Management Units are more than one field of the virtual address for paging.


|  |  |  |  | 
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
|  ... | ...  | ... | offset  |

(b) What is the content of each field?

(c) Draw the data structure that uses **four** fields and allows mapping a virtual address to the corresponding physical address.

(d) Which is the overhead for this MMU?

(e) What is the content of the fields of the Translation Lookaside Buffer for this MMU?

### Solution

## Point 4

### Question

(3.0 marks) *(motivate all yes/no answers)*
How is it possible to terminate a WIN32 thread?
Can a thread be terminated but another thread or is just self-termination possible?
Can multiple handles refer the same thread?
Is a thread handle automatically closed upon thread termination?
Can a thread be suspended/resumed (if yes, how)? Is self-suspension/resumption possible?



### Solution

## Point 5

### Question

(3.0 marks) Explain the role of filter expressions in `try...except` blocks. why/when do the following block call Filter functions?

```c
DWORD Filter (DWORD ExCode, int select){
	printf("In filter %d\n", select);
	switch(ExCode){
	...
	}
}

int i=0;
_try {
	for (i=0; i<4; i++) _try {
		_try {
			//statements
			...
		}
		_finally {
			printf("in finally\n");
		}
	}	_except(Filter (GetExceptionCode(), i)) {
		printf("In except 1\n");
	}
}	_except(Filter (GetExceptionCode(), i+4)) {
	printf("In except 2\n", );
}
```

What is the role of `GetExceptionCode()` ? Under which conditions is `Filter` called?
Why two calls to the same `Filter` function? How can the `Filter` routine behave differently in the two exception handlers? Can `Filter(GetExceptionCode(), i+4)` be called when `Filter(GetExceptionCode, i)` returns `EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_EXECUTION`? *(motivate all yes/no answers)*.
When is `"In finally\n"` printed (consider the case of no exception raised and a the case of an exception NOT raised)?
Is it possible for the program to print messages in one (or more) of the following orders (motivate answers)? *(prints are partial)*

| A |  B |  C  | D |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| In except 1<br/> In filter 2<br/> In except 2 |  In filter 1 <br/> In filter 2 <br/> In finally | In filter 3 <br/> In finally <br/> In except | In filter 2 <br/> In finally <br/> In except 2 |
